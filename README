What's this?
============

GETA is a Japanese footware.  This is a part which is intended to put
under a PCB of 1.6mm thickness, so that the PCB can be fit into the
USB-A receptacle.   I design this for FS-BB48.

I designed FST-01 (Flying Stone Tiny ZERO-ONE) in 2011.  Then, I
manufactured the product.  Soon after that, I found that FST-01 is a
something like a course name for computer science in India.

If it were a course name, I'd say, "Get A-grade"!.


In ASCII art
============

I assume that the thickness of each layer is 0.2mm.
But it could be changed thinner or thicker.
It depends.

This is the figure.

Purpose of Layer 1 is to match the thickness of 1.84mm of USB device
board.


(2) Layer 2

                    <-->
                    2.0mm

Purpose of Layer 2 is to have a hole.  (Standard USB-A Plug use metal
for this and the thickness is 0.15mm.)


(3) Layer 3

         <---- 11.75mm -------->

       | |                     | | 3.0mm

       v +---------------------+ v
                 <---7.16mm---->

Purpose of Layer 3 is to support the USB device in the receptacle.
This is important for FS-BB48, where we assume touching the board for
the button.
